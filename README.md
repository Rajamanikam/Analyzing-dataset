### Project Overview

 **Our aim in this project is to explore the movie dataset and find some movies with high ratings. Your friend has just begun with his vacations and wants you to suggest some good movies for him to watch.**


### Learnings from the project

 - Analyzing Given Dataset Using Python
- Opening, closing files
- Reading the contents of CSV files for analzing
- Obtaing required data from given data set


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 1. explore_data() -->> It is main  function for  this project. It is used for exploring the list items & obtaining only the required elements from the dataset

2. duplicate_and_unique_movies() -->> This function is used for obtaining list of unique & duplicate items from dataset

3. movies_lang() -->> This function is used for extracting only the movies that are specific language from the given dataset

4. rate_bucket() -->> This function is used for obtaining the list of movies that are highly rated.












### Challenges faced

 - Using slicing technique for removing header
-  in determining the high review rated movies
- Droping particular row from list


### Additional pointers

 Good Project for learning Simple Data Anlazing
